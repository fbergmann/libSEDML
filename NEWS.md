## libSEDML 0.3.0

New Features

* Support for SED-ML L1V2
* Support for Notes / Annotations in both versions
* Support for AddXML / ChangeXML

Bug fixes:

* sorted issues in supporting both versions and their namespaces
* numerous improvements

Thanks of course to Sarah Keating, without whom the project would not have been possible, to Bertrand Moreau for helping to improve the CMake build and the Python Bindings.
