# LibSEDML
Some time ago I developed [libSedML](http://libsedml.sf.net) a C# library that fully supports [SED-ML](http://sed-ml.org) for SBML as well as CellML models for creation of the description just as for the execution of Simulation Experiments. However, frequently the question to a C++ based library comes up. This project makes use of [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) XML layer as well as code generation as starting point to produce a library for reading and writing of SED-ML models.

## Dependencies

This library requires libSBML to be present, as its XML parsing layer will be used. for that either expat, xerces-c or libXML2 needs to be available. Additionally libSEDML makes use of libnuml. All dependencies are available as git submodule. 

## Building Python wheels

Since all dependencies are included as submodules, be sure to checkout the project with submodules:

	git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fbergmann/libSEDML

Then a build is as easy as: 

	cd libSEDML
	python src/bindings/python/setup.py build

or install, if you prefer. It requires cmake and swig installed. 

## Building

This library uses [CMake](http://cmake.org) to build the library, so from an initial checkout all you would need todo is to run:


    mkdir build  
    cd build
    cmake -DLIBSBML_LIBRARY=< path to libsbml lib> -DLIBSBML_INCLUDE_DIR=< path to includes > ... -DEXTRA_LIBS= < comma separated list of xml libraries> 
    make  
    make install

Should libSBML be installed in a default location it will be found automatically. Note that you do need to list the xml libraries that libSBML was linked against. In most cases libSBML is compiled against libXML and have compression enabled, so your `EXTRA_LIBS` would be:

	EXTRA_LIBS=xml2;bz2;z;iconv

note the semicolon denoting the listing of several libraries. Of course you could also enter the full path to each individual file, just to give an example, on windows I use: 

	EXTRA_LIBS=D:/dependencies/lib/expat.lib

for linking against `expat` and indicating, that libSBML was compiled without compression.

## Documentation
API documentation is something to be added and pull requests are happily accepted to improve them. For now a basic doxygen file 
is provided and documentation can be generated after checkout like so: 

```bash
PROJECT_NUMBER=2.0.32 doxygen -x libSEDML.doxyfile > Doxyfile && doxygen
```

This expands the version number in the doxygen file, creates a temporary `Doxyfile` and runs doxygen with it. After that the 
generated documentation is available in the `./doc/html` folder.
