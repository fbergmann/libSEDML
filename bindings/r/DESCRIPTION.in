Description: LibSEDML is an open-source programming library designed to help you
	read, write, manipulate, translate, and validate SEDML files and data
	streams.  It is not an application itself (though it does come with
	example programs), but rather a library you can embed in your own
	applications. LibSEDML ${PACKAGE_VERSION} understands SEDML Level 1 Version 1. It's written in ISO C and C++ but can also be
	used from C#, Java, MATLAB, Octave, Perl, Python, and Ruby.
