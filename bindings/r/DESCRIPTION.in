Description: LibSEDML is an open-source programming library designed to help you 
	read, write, manipulate, translate, and validate SEDML files and data 
	streams.  It is not an application itself (though it does come with 
	example programs), but rather a library you can embed in your own 
	applications. LibSEDML ${PACKAGE_VERSION} understands SEDML Level 1 Version 1. It's written in ISO C and C++ but can also be 
	used from C#, Java, MATLAB, Octave, Perl, Python, and Ruby.
