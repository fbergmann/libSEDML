# Code Generation
The classes of libSEDML are first generated using the python scripts in this folder and later manually corrected. That allows to take care of the mundane getting / setting of elements and leaves time for the challenging bits. 

The python files have been created initially by Sarah Keating in her work with libSBML packages. The original repository is av available here on github:
