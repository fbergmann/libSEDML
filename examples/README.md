## LibSedML Examples

There are separate subdirectories for different programming languages:
"c" for example programs in the C language, "c++" for examples in C++,
"java" for examples in Java, etc.  You will first need to change your
working directory to one of these subdirectories.

To build the examples, please configure with the option `-DWITH_EXAMPLES=ON`.
