 * @class SedBase
 * @ingroup Core
 * @brief Implementation of %SedBase, the base class of most Sed objects.
 *
 * Most components in Sed are derived from a single abstract base type,
 * SedBase.  In addition to serving as the parent class for most other
 * classes of objects in Sed, this base type is designed to allow a
 * modeler or a software package to attach arbitrary information to each
 * major element or list in an Sed model.
 *
 * SedBase has an optional subelement called "notes".  It is intended to
 * serve as a place for storing optional information intended to be seen by
 * humans.  An example use of the "notes" element would be to contain
 * formatted user comments about the model element in which the "notes"
 * element is enclosed.  There are certain conditions on the XHTML content
 * permitted inside the "notes" element; please consult the <a
 * target="_blank" href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications">Sed
 * specification document</a> corresponding to the Sed Level and Version
 * of your model for more information about the requirements for "notes"
 * content.
 *
 * SedBase has another optional subelement called "annotation".  Whereas the
 * "notes" element described above is a container for content to be shown
 * directly to humans, the "annotation" element is a container for optional
 * software-generated content @em not meant to be shown to humans.  The
 * element's content type is <a target="_blank"
 * href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#elemdecls">XML type
 * "any"</a>, allowing essentially arbitrary data content.  Sed places
 * only a few restrictions on the organization of the content; these are
 * intended to help software tools read and write the data as well as help
 * reduce conflicts between annotations added by different tools.  As is
 * the case with "notes", it is important to refer to the <a
 * target="_blank" href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications">Sed
 * specification document</a> corresponding to the Sed Level and Version
 * of your model for more information about the requirements for
 * "annotation" content.
 *
 * It is worth pointing out that the "annotation" element in the definition
 * of SedBase exists in order that software developers may attach optional
 * application-specific data to the elements in an Sed model.  However, it
 * is important that this facility not be misused.  In particular, it is
 * <em>critical</em> that data essential to a model definition or that can
 * be encoded in existing Sed elements is <em>not</em> stored in
 * "annotation". Parameter values, functional dependencies between model
 * elements, etc., should not be recorded as annotations.  It is crucial to
 * keep in mind the fact that data placed in annotations can be freely
 * ignored by software applications.  If such data affects the
 * interpretation of a model, then software interoperability is greatly
 * impeded.
 *
 * Sed Level 2 introduced an optional SedBase attribute named "metaid" for
 * supporting metadata annotations using RDF (<a target="_blank"
 * href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource Description Format</a>). The
 * attribute value has the data type <a
 * href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML ID</a>, the XML identifier
 * type, which means each "metaid" value must be globally unique within an
 * Sed file.  (Importantly, this uniqueness criterion applies across any
 * attribute with type <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML
 * ID</a>, not just the "metaid" attribute used by Sed&mdash;something to
 * be aware of if your application-specific XML content inside the
 * "annotation" subelement happens to use <a
 * href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML ID</a>.)  The "metaid" value
 * serves to identify a model component for purposes such as referencing
 * that component from metadata placed within "annotation" subelements.
 *
 * Beginning with Sed Level 2 Version 3, SedBase also has an optional
 * attribute named "sboTerm" for supporting the use of the Systems Biology
 * Ontology.  In Sed proper, the data type of the attribute is a string of
 * the form "SBO:NNNNNNN", where "NNNNNNN" is a seven digit integer number;
 * libSed simplifies the representation by only storing the "NNNNNNN"
 * integer portion.  Thus, in libSed, the "sboTerm" attribute on SedBase has
 * data type @c int, and SBO identifiers are stored simply as integers.
 * (For convenience, SedBase offers methods for returning both the integer
 * form and a text-string form of the SBO identifier.)  SBO terms are a
 * type of optional annotation, and each different class of Sed object
 * derived from SedBase imposes its own requirements about the values
 * permitted for "sboTerm".  Please consult the Sed Level&nbsp;2
 * Version&nbsp;4 specification for more information about the use of SBO
 * and the "sboTerm" attribute.
 *
 * Finally, note that, in the list of methods on SedBase, there is no public
 * constructor because SedBase is an abstract class.  The constructors reside
 * in the subclasses derived from SedBase.
 *
 *
 * @section sbase-miriam Standard format for annotations linking data resources
 *
 * Sed Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4, and Level&nbsp;3, define a proposed
 * regular format for encoding two particular categories of annotations:
 * (a) references to controlled vocabulary terms and database identifiers
 * which define and describe biological and biochemical entities in a
 * model; and (b) descriptions of the provenance of a model, including its
 * author(s) and modification history.

   * Returns the value of the "id" attribute of this object, if it has one.
   *
   * Most (but not all) objects in Sed include two common attributes: "id"
   * and "name".  The identifier given by an object's "id" attribute value
   * is used to identify the object within the Sed model definition.
   * Other objects can refer to the component using this identifier.  The
   * data type of "id" is always either <code>Sid</code> or
   * <code>UnitSId</code>, depending on the object in question.  Both
   * data types are defined as follows:
   * <pre style="margin-left: 2em; border: none; font-weight: bold; color: black">

   *   idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
   *   SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*
   * </pre>
   *
   * The equality of <code>SId</code> and <code>UnitSId</code> type values
   * in Sed is determined by an exact character sequence match; i.e.,

   * NOTE: THIS IS FOR BACKWARD COMPATABILITY REASONS
   *
   * Returns the value of the "name" attribute of this object, if it has one.
   *
   * Most (but not all) objects in Sed include two common attributes: "id"
   * and "name".  In contrast to the "id" attribute, the "name" attribute is
   * optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes
   * within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable
   * label for the component.  The data type of "name" is the type
   * <code>string</code> defined in XML Schema.  Sed imposes no
   * restrictions as to the content of "name" attributes beyond those
   * restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.
   *
   * The recommended practice for handling "name" is as follows.  If a
   * software tool has the capability for displaying the content of "name"
   * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
   * component's label instead of the component's "id".  If the user
   * interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
   * display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the "name"
   * attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
   * should display the value of the "id" attribute instead.  (Script
   * language interpreters are especially likely to display "id" instead of
   * "name".)
   *
   * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
   * generate the values of "id" attributes should be aware some systems
   * may display the "id"'s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
   * take some care to have their software create "id" values that are: (a)
   * reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
   * meaningful, for example by making the "id" attribute be an abbreviated
   * form of the name attribute value.
   *
   * An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
   * restrictions on the uniqueness of "id" values, there are no
   * restrictions on the uniqueness of "name" values in a model.  This
   * allows software packages leeway in assigning component identifiers.

   *
   * Most (but not all) objects in Sed include two common attributes: "id"
   * and "name".  In contrast to the "id" attribute, the "name" attribute is
   * optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes
   * within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable

   * <code>string</code> defined in XML Schema.  Sed imposes no
   * restrictions as to the content of "name" attributes beyond those
   * restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.
   *
   * The recommended practice for handling "name" is as follows.  If a
   * software tool has the capability for displaying the content of "name"
   * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
   * component's label instead of the component's "id".  If the user
   * interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
   * display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the "name"
   * attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
   * should display the value of the "id" attribute instead.  (Script
   * language interpreters are especially likely to display "id" instead of
   * "name".)
   *
   * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
   * generate the values of "id" attributes should be aware some systems
   * may display the "id"'s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
   * take some care to have their software create "id" values that are: (a)
   * reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
   * meaningful, for example by making the "id" attribute be an abbreviated
   * form of the name attribute value.
   *
   * An additional point worth mentioning is although there are

  /*
   * NOTE: THIS IS FOR BACKWARD COMPATABILITY REASONS
   * Sets the value of the "name" attribute of this Sed object to a copy
   * of @p name.
   *
   * Most (but not all) objects in Sed include two common attributes: "id"
   * and "name".  In contrast to the "id" attribute, the "name" attribute is
   * optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes
   * within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable
   * label for the component.  The data type of "name" is the type
   * <code>string</code> defined in XML Schema.  Sed imposes no
   * restrictions as to the content of "name" attributes beyond those
   * restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.
   *
   * The recommended practice for handling "name" is as follows.  If a
   * software tool has the capability for displaying the content of "name"
   * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
   * component's label instead of the component's "id".  If the user
   * interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
   * display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the "name"
   * attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
   * should display the value of the "id" attribute instead.  (Script
   * language interpreters are especially likely to display "id" instead of
   * "name".)
   *
   * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
   * generate the values of "id" attributes should be aware some systems
   * may display the "id"'s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
   * take some care to have their software create "id" values that are: (a)
   * reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
   * meaningful, for example by making the "id" attribute be an abbreviated
   * form of the name attribute value.
   *
   * An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
   * restrictions on the uniqueness of "id" values, there are no
   * restrictions on the uniqueness of "name" values in a model.  This
   * allows software applications leeway in assigning component identifiers.
   *
   * @param name the new name for the object; the string will be copied
   *
   * @note The fact that the "name" attribute is defined on the SedBase parent
   * class object is a convenience provided by libSed, and <b>does not
   * strictly follow Sed specifications</b>.  This libSed implementation
   * of SedBase allows client applications to use more generalized code in
   * some situations (for instance, when manipulating objects that are all
   * known to have identifiers), but beware that not all Sed object
   * classes provide an "id" attribute.  LibSed will allow the identifier
   * to be set, but it will not read nor write "id" attributes for objects
   * that do not possess them according to the Sed specification for the
   * Level and Version in use.

   * optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes
   * within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable
   * label for the component.  The data type of "name" is the type
   * <code>string</code> defined in XML Schema.  Sed imposes no
   * restrictions as to the content of "name" attributes beyond those
   * restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.
   *
   * The recommended practice for handling "name" is as follows.  If a
   * software tool has the capability for displaying the content of "name"
   * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
   * component's label instead of the component's "id".  If the user
   * interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
   * display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the "name"
   * attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
   * should display the value of the "id" attribute instead.  (Script
   * language interpreters are especially likely to display "id" instead of
   * "name".)
   *
   * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
   * generate the values of "id" attributes should be aware some systems
   * may display the "id"'s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
   * take some care to have their software create "id" values that are: (a)
   * reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
   * meaningful, for example by making the "id" attribute be an abbreviated
   * form of the name attribute value.
   *
   * An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
   * restrictions on the uniqueness of "id" values, there are no
   * restrictions on the uniqueness of "name" values in a model.  This
   * allows software applications leeway in assigning component identifiers.
