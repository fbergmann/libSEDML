 * @class SedConstructorException
 * @ingroup Core
 * @brief Class of exceptions thrown by constructors of some libSed objects.
 *
 * In some situations, constructors for Sed objects may need to indicate to
 * callers that the creation of the object failed.  The failure may be for
 * different reasons, such as an attempt to use invalid parameters or a
 * system condition such as a memory error.  To communicate this to callers,
 * those classes will throw an SedConstructorException.
 *
 * In languages that don't have an exception mechanism (e.g., C), the
 * constructors generally try to return an error code instead of throwing
 * an exception.
