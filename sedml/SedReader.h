 * @class SedReader
 * @ingroup Core
 * @brief Methods for reading Sed from files and text strings.
 *
 * @htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
 *
 * The SedReader class provides the main interface for reading Sed
 * content from files and strings.  The methods for reading Sed all return
 * an SedDocument object representing the results.
 *
 * In the case of failures (such as if the Sed contains errors or a file
 * cannot be read), the errors will be recorded with the SedErrorLog
 * object kept in the SedDocument returned by SedReader.  Consequently,
 * immediately after calling a method on SedReader, callers should always
 * check for errors and warnings using the methods for this purpose
 * provided by SedDocument.
 *
 * For convenience as well as easy access from other languages besides C++,
 * this file also defines two global functions,
 * libsbml::readSedML(@if java String filename@endif)
 * and libsbml::readSedMLFromString(@if java String xml@endif).
 * They are equivalent to creating an SedReader
 * object and then calling the
 * SedReader::readSedML(@if java String filename@endif) or
 * SedReader::readSedMLFromString(@if java String xml@endif)
 * methods, respectively.
 *
 * @section compression Support for reading compressed files
 *
 * LibSed provides support for reading (as well as writing) compressed
 * Sed files.  The process is transparent to the calling
 * application&mdash;the application does not need to do anything
 * deliberate to invoke the functionality.  If a given Sed filename ends
 * with an extension for the @em gzip, @em zip or @em bzip2 compression
 * formats (respectively, @c .gz, @c .zip, or @c .bz2), then the methods
 * SedReader::readSedML(@if java String filename@endif) and
 * SedWriter::writeSed(@if java SedDocument d, String filename@endif)
 * will automatically decompress and compress the file while writing and
 * reading it.  If the filename has no such extension, it
 * will be read and written uncompressed as normal.
 *
 * The compression feature requires that the @em zlib (for @em gzip and @em
 * zip formats) and/or @em bzip2 (for @em bzip2 format) be available on the
 * system running libSed, and that libSed was configured with their
 * support compiled-in.  Please see the libSed @if clike <a href="libsbml-installation.html">installation instructions</a> @endif@if python <a href="libsbml-installation.html">installation instructions</a> @endif@if java  <a href="../../../libsbml-installation.html">installation instructions</a> @endif@~ for more information about this.  The methods
 * @if java SedReader::hasZlib()@else hasZlib()@endif@~ and
 * @if java SedReader::hasBzip2()@else hasBzip2()@endif@~
 * can be used by an application to query at run-time whether support
 * for the compression libraries is available in the present copy of
 * libSed.
 *
 * Support for compression is not mandated by the Sed standard, but
 * applications may find it helpful, particularly when large Sed models
 * are being communicated across data links of limited bandwidth.
