/**
 * An enumeration of Sed types to help identify Sed objects at runtime.
 * Abstract types do not have a typecode since they cannot be instantiated.
 *
 * (NOTES)
 *
 *  - Each typecode is used as a return value (int) of the following functions
 *
 *     - virtual int SedBase::getTypeCode() const;
 *     - virtual int ListOf::getItemTypeCode() const;
 *
 *    (In libSed 5, the type of return values in these functions have been changed
 *     from typecode (int) to int for extensibility.)
 *
 *  - Each pacakge extension must define similar enum type for each SedBase subclass
 *    (e.g. SedLayoutTypeCode_t for the layout extension, SedGroupTypeCode_t for
 *          group extension).
 *
 *  - The value of each typecode can be duplicated between those of different
 *    packages.
 *
 *  - To distinguish the typecodes of different packages, not only the return
 *    value of getTypeCode() but also that of getPackageName() must be checked
 *    as follows:
 *
 *       void example (const SedBase *sb)
 *       {
 *         cons std::string pkgName = sb->getPackageName();
 *         if (pkgName == "core")
 *         {
 *           switch (sb->getTypeCode())
 *           {
 *             case SEDML_MODEL:
 *                ....
 *                break;
 *             case SEDML_REACTION:
 *                ....
 *           }
 *         }
 *         else if (pkgName == "layout")
 *         {
 *           switch (sb->getTypeCode())
 *           {
 *             case SEDML_LAYOUT_LAYOUT:
 *                ....
 *                break;
 *             case SEDML_LAYOUT_REACTIONGLYPH:
 *                ....
 *           }
 *         }
 *         ...
 *       }
