 * @class SedVisitor
 * @ingroup Core
 * @brief Support class for performing operations on Sed objects.
 *
 * <em style='color: #555'>This class of objects is defined by libSed only
 * and has no direct equivalent in terms of Sed components.</em>
 *
 * This is a class that supports the use of the <a target="_blank"
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)"><i>Visitor
 * Pattern</i></a> to perform operations on Sed objects.  The LibSed
 * implementation of the Visitor Pattern couples the notion of visitation
 * with the traversal of an Sed model oject hierarchy.
 *
 * This class (SedVisitor) does not provide stand-alone functionality;
 * rather, it defines the interface that user visitor classes must
 * implement.  All of the individual Sed object classes have methods named
 * <code>accept</code> that are used for invoking an object of class
 * SedVisitor.  An example of its use is in the Sed validation system,
 * which is internally implemented using this Visitor Pattern facility.
