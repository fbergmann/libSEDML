 * @class SedWriter
 * @ingroup Core
 * @brief Methods for writing Sed to files and text strings.
 *
 * @htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
 *
 * The SedWriter class is the converse of SedReader, and provides the
 * main interface for serializing Sed models into XML and writing the
 * result to files and text strings.  The methods for writing Sed all take
 * an SedDocument object and a destination.  They return a boolean or
 * integer value to indicate success or failure.
 *
 * @section compression Support for writing compressed files
 *
 * LibSed provides support for writing (as well as reading) compressed
 * Sed files.  The process is transparent to the calling
 * application&mdash;the application does not need to do anything
 * deliberate to invoke the functionality.  If a given Sed filename ends
 * with an extension for the @em gzip, @em zip or @em bzip2 compression
 * formats (respectively, <code>&quot;.gz&quot;</code>,
 * <code>&quot;.zip&quot;</code>, or <code>&quot;.bz2&quot;</code>),
 * then the methods
 * SedWriter::writeSedML(@if java SedDocument d, String filename@endif)
 * and SedReader::readSed(@if java String filename@endif)
 * will automatically compress and decompress the file while writing and
 * reading it.  If the filename has no such extension, it
 * will be written and read uncompressed as normal.
 *
 * The compression feature requires that the @em zlib (for @em gzip and @em
 * zip formats) and/or @em bzip2 (for @em bzip2 format) be available on the
 * system running libSed, and that libSed was configured with their
 * support compiled-in.  Please see the libSed @if clike <a href="libsbml-installation.html">installation instructions</a>@endif@if python <a href="libsbml-installation.html">installation instructions</a>@endif@if java  <a href="../../../libsbml-installation.html">installation instructions</a>@endif@~ for
 * more information about this.  The methods
 * SedWriter::hasZlib() and
 * SedWriter::hasBzip2()
 * can be used by an application to query at run-time whether support
 * for the compression libraries is available in the present copy of
 * libSed.
 *
 * Support for compression is not mandated by the Sed standard, but
 * applications may find it helpful, particularly when large Sed models
 * are being communicated across data links of limited bandwidth.
