 * The file <tt>libsedml-package.h</tt> is generated from the file
 * <tt>libsedml-package.h.in</tt> by the @c configure script at the top
 * level of the libSEDML source tree.
 *
 * @note This file is handled unusually.  The file itself is generated by
 * @c configure, but unlike other files that are likewise automatically
 * generated, it is also checked into the source repository.  The need for
 * this is due to the fact that under Windows, developers may not be
 * running @c configure at all (e.g., if they are using the MSVC
 * environment).  The .h file therefore needs to be provided directly in
 * order for people to be able to compile the sources under Windows.
 * Developers must remember to check in the .h version of this file in the
 * source code repository prior to major releases, so that an up-to-date .h
 * file is present in distributions.  This is admittedly an undesirable and
 * error-prone situation, but it is currently the best alternative we have
 * been able to find.
