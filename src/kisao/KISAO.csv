Levenberg first suggested an improvement to the Newton method in order to make it more robust, i.e. to overcome the problem of non-convergence. His suggestion was to add a factor to the diagonal elements of the Hessian matrix of second derivatives when not close to the minimum (this can be judged by how positive definite the matrix is). The effect when this factor is large compared to the elements of Hessian is that the method then becomes the steepest descent method. Later Marquardt suggested that the factor should be multiplicative rather than additive and also defined a heuristic to make this factor increase or decrease.

The simulated annealing optimization algorithm uses a similar concept: the objective function is considered a measure of the energy of the system and this is maintained constant for a certain number of iterations (a temperature cycle). In each iteration, the parameters are changed to a nearby location in parameter space and the new objective function value calculated; if it decreased, then the new state is accepted, if it increased then the new state is accepted with a probability that follows a Boltzmann distribution (higher temperature means higher probability of accepting the new state). After a fixed number of iterations, the stopping criterion is checked; if it is not time to stop, then the system's temperature is reduced and the algorithm continues.
